## 3. The 31 AI Agent Team

The platform will be built and maintained by a team of 31 specialized AI agents, organized into 6 functional categories under a distributed orchestration system. This represents the most comprehensive agentic deployment system ever created for a national-scale software project.

### 3.1. Distributed Orchestration Architecture

**CRITICAL UPDATE:** The platform uses a **distributed orchestration system** with 1 Master Orchestrator + 6 Category Orchestrators (named after Islamic Golden Age philosophers) to enable parallel execution, avoid bottlenecks, and speed up development.

![Distributed Orchestration](../diagrams/distributed_orchestration.png)

**Tier 1 - Master Orchestration:**  
The **Master Orchestrator** coordinates 6 Category Orchestrators:

1. **Al-Kindi** (Development) - "Philosopher of the Arabs" - 11 development agents
2. **Al-Farabi** (Infrastructure) - "The Second Master" - 3 infrastructure agents
3. **Ibn Sina** (Intelligence) - "Prince of Physicians" - 4 intelligence agents
4. **Ibn Rushd** (Content) - "The Commentator" - 3 content agents
5. **Al-Ghazali** (Specialized) - "Proof of Islam" - 4 specialized agents
6. **Ibn Khaldun** (Strategic) - "Father of Sociology" - 5 strategic agents

**Tier 2 - Category Orchestration:**  
Six Category Orchestrators coordinate agents within their functional categories, enabling 6× parallel execution.

**Tier 3 - Execution:**  
Thirty-one specialized agents execute tasks assigned by their Category Orchestrators.

*For complete distributed orchestration specification, see `NOOR_Distributed_Orchestration_System.md`*

### 3.2. Agent Categories & Operating Modes

**NEW in v7.1:** All agents operate in three distinct modes to ensure legal defensibility and regulatory compliance:

**Advisory / Insights Mode:**  
Agents generate recommendations, learning pathways, career advice, and analytics. They use Planning + Reflection patterns before surfacing outputs. Examples: Radiant AI career guidance, HR Analytics dashboards.

**Validation / Compliance Mode:**  
Agents check authenticity, validate data, and flag anomalies but **do not update source-of-truth records**. They use Tool Use + Exception Handling patterns. Examples: Sick leave validation with SEHA/DHA, payroll compliance checks.

**Coordination / Orchestration Mode:**  
Agents prepare complex reports, coordinate multi-step workflows, and aggregate data. They use Multi-Agent Collaboration + Human-in-the-Loop patterns. Examples: Federal Intelligence Agent preparing Cabinet reports, Emiratization Quality Index calculation.

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:** Agents propose, validate, score, and predict — but **only deterministic microservices write to canonical databases**. This protects integrity, auditability, and legal defensibility.

### 3.3. Complete Agent Roster (31 Agents)

## 6. Target-State Architecture

**NEW in v7.1:** This section defines the production-ready architecture for NOOR at national scale (5M+ citizens, thousands of institutions, federal analytics). This architecture is designed to be **regulator-proof**, **politically survivable**, and **legally defensible**.

### 6.1. Macro Architecture - 4 Layers + Audit Plane

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:** Hard separation between layers enforces governance, auditability, and legal defensibility.

![Target-State Architecture](../diagrams/target_state_architecture.png)

#### Layer 1: Experience Layer (Interfaces)

**Individual:**
- Skills Passport
- Radiant AI
- Career Pathway
- Token Wallet
- Health & Wellness Dashboard

**Institutional:**
- HR Dashboards
- Payroll & Pensions
- Leave & Compliance
- Emiratization Quality Index
- Learning & Development

**Federal:**
- Policy Simulator
- ESG Impact
- National Workforce View
- Labor Market Analytics

**Technology:** React (web), React Native (mobile)  
**Rule:** Interfaces never call AI agents directly; all requests go through API Gateway

#### Layer 2: Orchestration & Policy Layer (Agent Mesh)

**Components:**
- 31 specialized AI agents
- 6 Category Orchestrators (Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd, Al-Ghazali, Ibn Khaldun)
- 1 Master Orchestrator
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) for inter-agent communication

**Responsibilities:**
- Planning, routing, reflection, escalation
- Governance logic and policy enforcement
- Agentic design patterns: routing, planning, reflection, human-in-the-loop, exception handling

**Technology:** Python, LangChain, FastAPI, MCP  
**Rule:** Agents propose, validate, score, predict — but do NOT write to source-of-truth databases

#### Layer 3: Service Layer (Deterministic Microservices)

**Core Services:**
- Payroll & Pensions Service
- Employee Lifecycle Service
- Learning & Assessment Service
- Emiratization Compliance Service
- EQI (Emiratization Quality Index) Service
- Health Certification Service
- Biometric Identity Service

**Responsibilities:**
- ONLY these services are allowed to mutate canonical data in databases
- Enforce business rules and data integrity
- Provide deterministic, auditable operations

**Technology:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j  
**Rule:** All state changes must go through deterministic services, not agents

#### Layer 4: Data Layer (Sovereign Data Fabric)

**Databases:**
- **PostgreSQL:** Payroll, leave, pension rules, compliance records
- **MongoDB:** Engagement logs, appraisals narrative, feedback
- **Neo4j:** Competency graph, mentor graph, career path mapping, workforce network
- **Redis:** Sessions, dashboards cache
- **Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate):** Embeddings for Radiant AI and workforce intelligence
- **Kafka:** Event streaming, ETL into analytics, audit lineage

**Data Zoning:**
- **L1 Personal Zone:** User-scoped encryption keys
- **L2 Institutional Zone:** Company-scoped encryption keys
- **L3 Federal Zone:** Differentially-private aggregates only

**Technology:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j, Redis, Elasticsearch, Kafka  
**Rule:** All data stored within UAE borders (data residency requirement)

#### Audit / Governance Plane

**Components:**
- Consent ledger (blockchain)
- RBAC/ABAC policy store
- Immutable access logs
- Rate limits
- Human-approval checkpoints

**Purpose:**
- Makes the system politically survivable
- Institutions and the state can prove lawful behavior
- Critical for payroll, pension, health data, Emiratization compliance, national planning

**Technology:** HashiCorp Vault, Blockchain (consent), Elasticsearch (audit logs)  
**Rule:** Every action must be auditable and traceable

### 6.2. Agent Operating Modes (Production Patterns)

**Advisory / Insights Mode:**
- **Example:** Radiant AI generating learning pathway for a citizen
- **Pattern:** Planning + Reflection before showing output
- **Agents:** Radiant AI, HR Analytics, Talent Intelligence

**Validation / Compliance Mode:**
- **Example:** Sick leave claim validation with SEHA/DHA
- **Pattern:** Tool Use + Exception Handling
- **Rule:** Agent checks authenticity and flags anomalies, but does NOT update leave records
- **Agents:** Culture & Engagement, Payroll Compliance, Security

**Coordination / Orchestration Mode:**
- **Example:** Federal Intelligence Agent preparing Emiratization Quality Index report for Cabinet
- **Pattern:** Multi-Agent Collaboration + Human-in-the-Loop (Cabinet approval gate)
- **Agents:** Federal Intelligence, Master Orchestrator, Emiratization Compliance

### 6.3. Core Agentic Patterns (Infrastructure Level)

**Routing (Chapter 2):**  
Master Orchestrator or Category Orchestrator classifies request and routes to correct specialist agent (Payroll Compliance, Health Certification, Learning & Development, etc.)

**Planning (Chapter 6):**  
For complex flows (e.g., onboarding new employee across payroll, pension, role grading, relocation), orchestrator produces structured multi-step plan. Plan is stored for traceability.

**Reflection (Chapter 4):**  
Before high-risk outputs (compensation benchmarking, Emiratization scoring, ESG claims, federal projections), Critic/Reviewer agent evaluates. Output released only if passes review, or escalated to human.

**Human-in-the-Loop (Chapter 13):**  
Certain actions require explicit human approval recorded in audit:
- Payroll & pension contributions
- Medical leave certification and "fit for duty" outcomes
- Emiratization Quality Index scoring
- Federal Workforce / ESG dashboards at national level

**This protects reputational, legal, and geopolitical risk.**

### 6.4. Infrastructure & Network Segmentation

**Kubernetes Deployment:**

**General-Purpose Pool:**
- Standard microservices (FastAPI, Kafka, Redis)
- Frontend/backend services
- API Gateway

**GPU-Enabled Inference Pool:**
- High-load AI agents (Radiant AI, Mentor Matching, Predictive Analytics)
- Vector database operations
- Embedding generation

**High-Sensitivity Pool:**
- Payroll & Pensions
- Health certification / SEHA-DHA integration
- Biometric broker / identity binding
- Network policies enforce isolation

**Rationale:** Guild chat feature cannot call biometric broker; payroll service cannot access personal health data.

**Network Zones Aligned with Legal Exposure:**

**Personal Zone (L1):**
- Biometric embeddings
- Allergies, chronic conditions, blood type, medications, emergency contacts
- Work-life balance / Meaning Quotient scoring
- Radiant AI guidance
- Encryption: User-scoped keys
- Consent: Lives here

**Institutional Zone (L2):**
- Payroll, leave approvals, relocation management
- Performance appraisals, competency frameworks
- Emiratization Quality Index for entity
- Onboarding experience analytics
- Encryption: Company-scoped keys
- No cross-company bleed

**Federal Zone (L3):**
- Aggregated + anonymized analytics ONLY
- No PII, no biometrics, no payroll-line data, no medical data
- Differential privacy (ε ≤ 1.0) and k-anonymity (k ≥ 100)

**Protection:** When regulators ask "Are you centralizing sensitive data at federal level?", answer is **No. Federal layer only receives statistically safe aggregates.**

### 6.5. Data Plane and Memory Management

**Short-term Memory:**
- Per-session state (conversation, plan state)
- Lives in Redis and transient agent context
- Cleared after session ends

**Long-term Memory:**
- Stored embeddings in Vector DB
- Graph structures in Neo4j:
  - Skills progression
  - Mentoring relationships
  - Learning pathways
  - Institutional competency frameworks
  - Cross-sector career path projections

**Authoritative Business Records:**
- Payroll, pension, leave, relocation, appraisal
- Stay in PostgreSQL (auditable, transactionally solid)

**Narrative / Qualitative Data:**
- Engagement surveys, feedback, performance notes
- Lives in MongoDB

**Streaming / Lineage:**
- Kafka captures all relevant events
- Feeds monitoring, analytics, Federal aggregate layer

**CRITICAL:** No agent should "remember" data it is not allowed to access later. Memory retrieval must be filtered by RBAC/ABAC before context is rehydrated into a prompt.

### 6.6. Governance, Cost, and Trust

**Goal Registry & KPI Binding:**
- Each specialized agent registers: what it optimizes, what metrics it owns
- Examples: retention rate, onboarding satisfaction, pay equity variance, Emiratization quality, L&D completion impact
- Makes each agent auditable like a business unit

**Resource Governor / Cost Optimization Agent:**
- Routes low-risk work to cheaper models
- Batches non-urgent inference
- Enforces budget ceilings
- Sits between Orchestrator and GPU pool

**Consent Ledger & Audit Journal:**
- Immutable record of:
  - Who accessed what data
  - For what purpose
  - Using which agent
  - With/without human approval
