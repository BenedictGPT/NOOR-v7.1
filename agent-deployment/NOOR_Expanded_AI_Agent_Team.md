# NOOR Platform - Expanded AI Agent Team Design

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Purpose:** Formal design of the expanded 26-agent AI team for the NOOR platform

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The NOOR platform will be built and maintained by a team of **26 specialized AI agents** working in coordinated teams. This expanded team is organized into **5 categories** based on their primary function:

1. **Development Agents (12):** Build the platform software
2. **Infrastructure Agents (3):** Manage platform operations
3. **Intelligence Agents (4):** Provide AI-powered insights
4. **Content Agents (3):** Create and manage platform content
5. **Specialized Domain Agents (4):** Handle specific platform features

This document provides a formal definition of each agent category, a complete list of all 26 agents, and a visual diagram of the agent coordination model.

## 4. Agent Coordination Model

### 4.1. Hierarchical Tiers

The agent team is organized into **4 hierarchical tiers** to ensure efficient coordination:

**Tier 1: Orchestrator**
- The **Orchestrator Agent** is the central coordinator, responsible for task decomposition, assignment, and progress monitoring.

**Tier 2: Infrastructure & Intelligence**
- **Infrastructure Agents** (Database Management, Monitoring, Cost Optimization) provide foundational services to all other agents.
- **Intelligence Agents** (Scholar, Radiant AI, Mentor Matching, Predictive Analytics) provide AI-powered insights and features.

**Tier 3: Development & Specialized**
- **Development Agents** (Frontend, Backend, etc.) build the core platform software.
- **Specialized Domain Agents** (Assessment, Guilds, etc.) handle specific business logic.

**Tier 4: Support**
- **Content Agents** (Content Creation, Translation, Competency Library) provide content and translation services to all other agents.

### 4.2. Visual Diagram

    end

    subgraph Tier 4 - Support

    Orchestrator --> Intelligence_Agents
    Orchestrator --> Development_Agents
    Orchestrator --> Specialized_Agents
    Orchestrator --> Content_Agents

    Infrastructure_Agents --> Development_Agents

    Intelligence_Agents --> Specialized_Agents

    Content_Agents --> Development_Agents
    Content_Agents --> Specialized_Agents

    Development_Agents --> Orchestrator
    Specialized_Agents --> Orchestrator
```

### 4.3. Communication Protocols

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** All inter-agent communication will use MCP for standardized messaging.
- **Jira:** The Orchestrator will use Jira for task management and tracking.
- **Slack:** Automated notifications and alerts will be sent to a dedicated Slack channel.

---

## 5. Next Steps

1. Create detailed specifications for each of the 26 agents.
2. Define MCP integrations and API requirements for each agent.
3. Create a comprehensive tools and services catalog.
4. Finalize the Product Requirements Document (PRD).

---

**Design Complete:** Expanded 26-agent team with defined roles, categories, and coordination model.
