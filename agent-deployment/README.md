## Key Concepts

### Agentic Development
The NOOR platform is built using an **agentic development model**, where autonomous AI agents work alongside human developers to build and maintain the platform. Each agent is a specialized team member with specific roles and responsibilities.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
All agent communication is mediated through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, a standardized, asynchronous, message-based communication system that ensures all interactions are logged and auditable.
